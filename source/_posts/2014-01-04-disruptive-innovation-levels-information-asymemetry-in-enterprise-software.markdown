Selecting enterprise software is a daunting task that requires knowledge to make a good decision. A misguided outcome
could cost your organization a great deal in implementation expenses and lost productivity.  Unfortunately, the
information you may need to arrive at the right decision for your circumstance could be hard to find. Obscure product
websites, confusing suites of bundled features, and crafty sales people who are adept at upselling benefits all too
often obstruct the decision process. If only picking an enterprise software package were as simple as researching
reviews for a restaurant or comparing the latest iGadgets from Apple… but wait!

Now with [G2Crowd](http://www.g2crowd.com/){:target="_blank"}, the wisdom of the cloud is here to help. Access thousands of reviews from users of all spectrums –
from managers to direct end users. G2 even has a useful Q&A facility to prompt discussions by allowing you to ask other
users for their opinions on a given product.

G2Crowd is an incredible resource because no other place allows you to compare a wide variety of software packages side
by side. No longer will the marketing budgets of elephant-in-the-room vendors so easily drown out the smaller, more
nimble competition. For example, Salesforce.com is the go-to name in CRM but may not be the right solution for everyone.
Through product reviews and comparisons on G2Crowd you may find that a lesser known CRM alternative like Chicago’s own
Base CRM has a better set of features that’s right for you.

We’ve seen the Internet flatten information asymmetry in industries far and wide. Amazon.com is the comparison place
for goods of all sorts. Yelp will help you find the best place to dine in town. TripAdvisor will tell you where to
vacay. Now its time to level the playing field for the $180 billion global enterprise software market.
