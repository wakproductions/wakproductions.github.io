        %h2 Hi, I'm Winston Kotzan
      .about-me-bio
        I'm a software engineer and geek with a passion for technology and the capital markets. At the age of 12,
        I wrote my first program in QBASIC on my Packard Bell 386 computer and have ever since been hooked on
        coding. Today I am a Ruby on Rails web developer with a career that has included working on Wall Street
        as a stock analyst, healthcare, and tech startups. This page tells the story of my professional career.

.skills
  I like the problem solving aspects of creating software. Computers are best at organizing data and I like
  directing my talents in working with data toward solving practical problems. I'm strongest in SQL and back-end
  system design, but can also do full stack web development and enjoy the encompassing task of building a
  website to perform a specific task.
