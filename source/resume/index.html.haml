        %h2 Hi, I'm Winston Kotzan
      .about-me-bio
        I'm a software engineer and geek with a passion for technology and the capital markets. At the age of 12,
        I wrote my first program in QBASIC on my Packard Bell 386 computer and have ever since been hooked on
        coding. Today I am a Ruby on Rails web developer with a career that has included working on Wall Street
        as a stock analyst, healthcare, and tech startups.
